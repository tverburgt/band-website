== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I connect my Instagram account? =

Once you install Spotlight, a welcome screen appears that guides you on how to connect your first Instagram user account. Click on the connect button and it will show you two options, [Personal or Business](https://docs.spotlightwp.com/article/553-what-is-the-difference-between-instagram-personal-and-business-accounts). Pick the one that applies to you, authorize Spotlight through the popup that appears, and you’re all set.

- - -

= How many Instagram accounts can I connect? =

Spotlight has no limit on the number of Instagram accounts you may connect. So long as you have legitimate access to those accounts, you can connect them directly through Spotlight or by using an Instagram access token (for developers).

- - -

= Can I display posts from multiple Instagram users in one gallery? =

Yes. With Spotlight you can create feeds that feature photos and videos from multiple Instagram accounts within the same feed. Simply connect the Instagram user accounts you want to display posts from and select them in the "Connect" step of the feed editor in Spotlight.

- - -

= How many feeds can I set up? =

Spotlight sets no limit on the number of feeds you can set up. Design one for your footer, another for the sidebar, and one to fill an entire page - let your imagination run free. You can even show multiple feeds on the same page!

- - -

= Can I display multiple Instagram feeds on the same page or site? =

Yes. With Spotlight you can embed multiple Instagram feeds on a single page, a single post, in widget areas, and across your entire website. There are no limits and each feed can be unique or re-used in multiple places.

- - -

= Can I show full-size photos and play Instagram videos directly on my website? =

Yes, Spotlight's free version includes a lightbox (popup) option that will display your photos in their full size over your entire website. The lightbox can also play videos right on your site, no need to have the visitor leave your site at all! If you want to enhance the popup, [Spotlight PRO adds a sidebar](https://spotlightwp.com/pricing/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=readme_faq&utm_campaign=readme_faq_fullsizeandvideos) to the lightbox which will display your Instagram captions, comments, published date, and more.

- - -

= Where can I find my Instagram Access Token and User ID? =

Go to Spotlight > Settings. From the first page, Accounts, click on the Instagram username or the "info" icon under Actions. A modal will appear with all the details relating to your Instagram account - Spotlight ID, Instagram User ID, Instagram account type, Instagram Access Token, as well as your Instagram bio and profile picture.

- - -

= How can I only display posts that use a particular Instagram hashtag? =

With Spotlight PRO you can use either of two options. Firstly, you can choose to display posts that include a specific hashtag from all across Instagram ([learn more](https://docs.spotlightwp.com/article/622-how-to-display-hashtag-feeds)). Secondly, you can use Hashtag filtering to show or hide posts from your feed that use a specific hashtag. [Learn more.](https://spotlightwp.com/features/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=readme_faq&utm_campaign=readme_faq_hashtagfeed)

- - -

= Can I hide specific posts from my Instagram feed? =

Yes, we understand that you may have certain posts that you don't want to show on your website. By using the Moderation option in Spotlight PRO you can hand-pick the photos and videos that you either want to show or hide on your website. [Learn more.](https://spotlightwp.com/features/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=readme_faq&utm_campaign=readme_faq_moderation)

- - -

= Will the Instagram feed from Spotlight blend nicely into my website's theme? =

Yes, aside from the customization options provided by Spotlight itself, the plugin is also set up to use your theme's fonts to completely match your brand's look and feel on your website.

- - -

= Why is my Instagram feed not showing? =

There are a few reasons that your Instagram posts are not displayed on your site, either within Spotlight's editor or on the front-end. Here are the reasons and their potential fixes:

- **Caching Issues:** At times, the cache from your browser, website, hosting, DNS, or otherwise may cause your feeds to not be displayed. To fix this problem, try clearing all the cache options mentioned earlier and then refresh your pages.
- **Caching Plugin Conflicts:** Some plugins, such as W3 Total Cache, can conflict with Spotlight by minifying certain files that should not be minified. Taking W3 Total Cache as an example, simply disabling minification for just one of our JS files does the trick. By instructing W3 Total Cache to ignore the file, you should be able to get the feed working again on your site without sacrificing the performance of the rest of the page. The file in question is: wp-content/plugins/spotlight-social-photo-feeds/ui/dist/common.js
- **WP REST API Disabled:** We've found that certain websites use plugins or otherwise to disabled the WordPress REST API. Since Spotlight uses the WP REST API, if disabled, the plugin will not function correctly. Re-enabling the WP REST API should fix this issue.

If none of these solutions work for you, please do contact us through the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/spotlight-social-photo-feeds/) with a link to a page on your website where the Instagram feed is being displayed, details on how the above tests went, and if possible, a link to your Instagram account.
